Let’s get started by looking at the danceability feature:\n","\n","A song like The Real Slim Shady by Eminem has a danceability value of almost 1 (the maximum), while a piano song by Brahms has an energy of 0.18. Do these extremes make sense while listening to the songs?\n","In Silence, by Amelie Lens, has a danceability value that is almost equal than Sultans of Swing by the Dire Straits. Why do you think that this feature is not able to capture the difference between these songs? Are there other features able to capture the difference? Which ones?\n","Try to do the same for the rest of the audio features and note which ones do you think that matter the most, and which ones you might consider to exclude.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"r7AjbmzwscSO"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"Fx2WbIcSs5z5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680274013576,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1969,"user":{"displayName":"kalava sivalavanya","userId":"05755290286565672160"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","url =   'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s8u0PB125f2teAkV2wpkdnz4E76JpuAO/view?usp=share_link'  \n","path = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id='+url.split('/')[-2]\n","df_audio_features = pd.read_csv(path)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_audio_features"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":826},"id":"eMJR2Sd28-OA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680274013583,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":72,"user":{"displayName":"kalava sivalavanya","userId":"05755290286565672160"}},"outputId":"a820e1ef-7f95-47ef-b1e9-7c2af81e5fc1"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["  song_name                                                                 \\\n","0  My Band                                       ...                         \n","1  The Real Slim Shady                           ...                         \n","2  Águas De Março                                ...                         \n","3  The Girl From Ipanema                         ...                         \n","4  Paint It, Black                               ...                         \n","5  Sultans Of Swing                              ...                         \n","6  Space Raiders -
